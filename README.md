# KirklandKoders: Chess 2
### Rules:

- The movement of Chess 2 pieces is the same as traditional chess pieces
    - Pawn can move 1 space forward
    - Rook can freely move any spaces vertically OR horizontally
    - Bishop can freely move any spaces diagonally
    - Knight can move 2 spaces vertically and 1 space horizontally OR 1 space vertically and 2 spaces horizontally
    - Queen can freely move any spaces vertically OR horizontally or diagonally
    - King can move 1 space vertically OR horizontally OR diagonally

- New additions that differ from traditional chess:
    - Board is now 10x10 instead of 8x8
    - Each player starts with 2 extra pawns
    - If a **PAWN** moves in/into any of the **first 3 ranks** of the opposing player, that pawn gains the mobility of a **KING** until it is captured
    - Instead of moving a piece, a player may **place any captured piece as their own anywhere on the board**
        - **EXCEPTION:** There may not be more than one pawn per player in a column
        - If a pawn is placed within the opponents first three ranks, it **DOES NOT** receive king mobility until it moves from its intial placement
